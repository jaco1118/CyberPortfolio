# CyberPortfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity learning and research portfolio.
This repository serves as a knowledge base where I document my practice on platforms like **Hack The Box** and **TryHackMe**, as well as my research into web and network vulnerabilities.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 📦 Hack The Box
Walkthroughs and notes from retired machines, focusing on enumeration and exploitation paths.
- **Friendzone:** Enumeration of SMB shares and DNS to gain initial access.
- **Tabby:** Exploiting local file inclusion (LFI) and container breakouts.
- (Ongoing)

### 🏫 TryHackMe
Learning logs structured by vulnerability class and attack vector.
- **Vulnerability Research:** Deep dives into specific CVEs and exploitation techniques.
- **Web Application:**
  - **Authentication Bypass:** Analyzing flaws in login mechanisms.
  - **Content Discovery:** Fuzzing and directory enumeration techniques.
  - **File Inclusion:** Notes on LFI/RFI attacks and payloads.
  - **Subdomain Enumeration:** Mapping attack surfaces.

## 🤖 AI × Cyber Research (MSc Dissertation)
**Topic:** Generalised Autonomous AI Pentesting with GNN and RL in Varying Network Topologies.
- **Goal:** Developing an AI agent capable of generalizing attack strategies across different network structures, addressing the scalability limitations of current autonomous red-teaming models.
- **Methodology:** Utilizing **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** within the **Microsoft CyberBattleSim** environment to train agents on dynamic network graphs.
- **Status:** In progress (Environment setup and baseline benchmarking complete).

### 🛠️ Other Automation Tools
- **AI Log Summarizer:** Experimenting with LLMs to automate the summarization of vulnerability scan reports.
- **Auto Exploit Finder:** Early-stage script for automating CVE lookups and exploit mapping.
