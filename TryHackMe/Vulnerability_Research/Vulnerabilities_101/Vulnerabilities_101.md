Platform TryHackMe - Jr. Penetestration tester

Date: 5 Nov 2025

Objective: Understand different types of vulnerabilities

# Types of Vulnerability

| Vulnerability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Operating system | found within OS, result in privilege escalation |
| Misconfiguration-based | incorrectly configured application or service, such as a website exposing customer details |
| Weak or default credentials | default credentials, e.g. “admin” |
| Application logic | poorly designed application, poorly implemented authentication mechanisms  |
| Human factor | leverage human behaviour, such as phishing emails |

# Showcase: Exploting Ackme’s Application

**Information Gathering:** Found IP and service banner via nmap

**Enumeration:** Discovered version ACKme Portal 1.5.2

**Application Testing:** Found CVE in Exploit DB

**Exploit Method:** Command injection → Reverse shell gained

Lesson Learned:

- Always check for **version disclosure** first - easiest fingerprinting vector
- **Misconfiguration and weak creds** are still more common than zero-days
- Next time: automate enumeration → write Python script to parse nmap results

**Idea**

try using Chatgpt or other LLM to summarize exploit DB entries automatically
